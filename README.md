# Finacial-Data-Analysis-project
This is a Finacial Data Analysis project based on a bank  whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers.

The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), 
the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). 
Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
